# Cyber Threat Detection
In today's digital age, system security is of paramount importance. With increasingly sophisticated cyber threats, organisations face significant challenges in safeguarding their networks and preventing data breaches. Our algorithm provides real-time detection and analysis of cyber threats to enhance protective techniques used within the system.

Network flow analysis emerges as a powerful technique for detecting cyber threats by examining patterns and behaviors within network traffic. Network flows, often captured in NetFlow data, encapsulate key information about communication between network devices, including the source and destination IP addresses, port numbers, protocols used, and timestamps of communication.

The aim of this project is to leverage machine learning methods to develop a mechanism for cyber attack detection through network flow analysis. By harnessing the wealth of information present in NetFlow datasets, we seek to identify anomalous activities indicative of cyber attacks, such as intrusion attempts, malware propagation, and denial-of-service attacks.
